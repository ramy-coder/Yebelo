Important decisions taken:

1. Token Deposit Function makes a call to the overflow Handler function incase the value of the current slab 
   exceeds the limit when the tokens are deposited.
2. OverFlow handler function makes a recursive call to itself incase the value exceeds the slab again.
3. If the value of the Deposit is greater than the last limit then an error is thrown
